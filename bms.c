//Prerequisities: Working ADC + current measuring module

/*TODO: Design a battery management system (BMS) which will:
        - Read the actual current (and voltage) of the battery
        - Read the voltage input of the solar panels
        - Read the battery current output
        - Turn on/off the RPi based on the battery current and voltage level
